https://stu-bell.github.io/breathe


FEATURES

Intro text to breathe with the circle
slider for duration 
Add audio attribution to app (see below)
donation button (maybe in a menu rather than always visible)
colour themes (in the menu)

BUGS
- container must not be zoomed/moved
- circle must not expand off screen, or too close to the edges. Maybe set the max size and then scale it down rather than up?

WON'T DO
- embed youtube audio? Can you do this in a way without ads? Low value, user can just play their own music in the background if they wanted to...
